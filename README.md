# Machine Learning Project - Regression Techniques

This repo contains all code for a machine learning project I completed while attending the Technical University of Vienna. This project focused on the applications of various regression techniques using different datasets as listed below.

## Regression techniques
- Linear regression
- Support vector regression
- Gradient boosted decision tree
- H2O AutoML

## Datasets
- Bike sharing (Kaggle)
